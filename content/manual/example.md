## Text

Once you've completed [setup](..), you can get started adding [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) content by creating a `content` directory.

Then you can add a docs folder. You can name that folder anything you like, for example `docs` or `documentation` (or something in a different language!). For this guide, we'll call it `docs`:

## Code

```bash
mkdir content/docs
```

```yaml
---
title: My docs
description: Everything you need to know about my project
---
```

```markdown
Welcome to the docs page!
```

Don't like YAML? That's okay! Hugo also supports providing document metadata in JSON or TOML. Love that flexibility ðŸ’–
