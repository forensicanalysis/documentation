What is the artifactcollector? The artifactcollector is a tool to collect forensic artifacts on a system. It can be used in forensic investigations to extract specific data instead of creating full disk images. The artifactextractor can collect low-level (like $MFT) and high-level file artifacts as well as registry keys (e.g. run keys) which can then be used in forensic investigations.\\nFigure 1. Running the artifactextractor on Windows.\\nThe artifactcollector is a single binary that can be transferred to computers which are part of a forensic investigation.\\nDownload All releases of the artifactcollector can be downloaded from GitHub. Prebuild artifactcollectors for Windows, Linux and macOS are availabe. Those artifactcollectors collect a predefined set of artifacts which are mostly taken from the Sans FOR500 training. Sans provides a comprehensive poster explaining those artifacts.\\nUsage On Windows the artifactcollector.exe can be executed by double clicking it on the investigated machine. The user will be provided with a UAC prompt because the artifactcollector required administrator rights to run. The collection takes some minutes, depending on processing power and contained artifacts.\\nOn Linux and macOS the artifactcollector needs to be executed as root, e.g. sudo artifactcollector. macOS can still prevent the execution, in this case right click the artifactcollector, select \\u0026ldquo;Open\\u0026rdquo;, confirm \\u0026ldquo;Open\\u0026rdquo; and afterwards try again with sudo artifactcollector.\\nOutput The artifactcollecor will create a .forensicstore file and a log file. The log file serves two purposes: inform an investigator about errors during the collection but also give the user a way to know what elements were extracted. The forensicstore contains the results of the extraction and needs to be transferred back to the investigator.\\n\"","section":"Usage","summary":"The artifactcollector behaves like malware as it collects critical system files and might be detected as a virus or malware.

The artifactcollector can cater to these needs by collecting a different set of artifacts related to the situation.\\nCollect a custom set of artifacts  Clone the repository git clone https://github.com/forensicanalysis/artifactcollector. Run go generate to download all artifacts. Add artifact definition yaml files as needed in pack/artifacts. Do not edit the artifact definitions, as they will be overwritten. Edit pack/ac.yaml and add the artifacts you want to collect. Run go generate. This might yield some errors or problems in your artifacts. On windows you can move the syso into the root folder (e.g. cp resources\\\\artifactcollector.syso .) to enable the icon for the executable and the UAC popup. Run go build . to generates an executable.  Define artifacts A structured way to define forensic artifacts was introduced by Google in development of the grr endpoint client: https://github.com/ForensicArtifacts/artifacts. We use the forked https://github.com/forensicanalysis/artifacts as the main repository for forensic artifacts definitions, because the main project contains some issues.\\nThe artifacts are yaml documents that define different types of forensic artifacts:\\n Paths Directories Files Registry Keys and Values WMI Queries Command execution  Letâ€™s have a look at an artifact definition for Windows Prefetch files. The artifact defines the location of the prefetch files on Windows.\\nname: WindowsPrefetchFiles doc: Windows Prefetch files. sources: - type: FILE attributes: paths: [\\u0026#39;%%environ_systemroot%%\\\\Prefetch\\\\*.pf\\u0026#39;] separator: \\u0026#39;\\\\\\u0026#39; labels: [System] supported_os: [Windows] urls: [\\u0026#39;http://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/Prefetch\\u0026#39;] If added to the artifactcollector and included in the configuration file, the artifactcollector would collect all .pf files in %%environ_systemroot%%\\\\Prefetch. The %%environ_systemroot%% variable is replaced by the artifactcollector using the WindowsEnvironmentVariableSystemRoot artifact definition. Creating artifacts like can be done on a case by case basis if needed.\\nThe artifact definition format is described in detail in the Style Guide.\\nEmbed binaries Binaries can be added to pack/bin and than included into the artifactcollector in the go generate step. Additionally a corresponding COMMAND artifact like the following is required.\\nname: Autoruns sources: - type: COMMAND attributes: cmd: autorunsc.exe args: [\\u0026#34;-x\\u0026#34;, \\u0026#34;-accepteula\\u0026#34;] supported_os: [Windows] Currently the output to stdout and stderr is saved, but generated files are not collected.\\n\"","section":"Development","summary":"Forensic investigations differ and investigators have different approaches in forensic cases.
